        <p>We see lots of objects in various locations every day; alas, our memory is not perfect and we can not keep all of the visual information in our memory; in this case, we may use smart assistants which store information about what we have seen throughout the day.
            <br>On the next page you will see a video and some questions you may ask such assistant trying to remember a piece of information and answer a certain assistant may give you; the answer consists of visual part and text part; visual part is a frame retrieved from collection of frames of a video (letâ€™s imagine this is a video recorded by your viewpoint throughout the day), and a textual part is a direct answer to the question derived from the frame. Please, rate each answer as combination of frame and text.
            You can use the video as supplementary material: you do not need to fully watch it, but can skim through it to locate the moments related to questions.
            <br>Rate the components of each answer: frame, text and the answer on the whole. Please, rate each of the three on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being "the answer is absolutely useless and doesn't help at all" and 7 being "the answer really helps to answer the question".
            <br>If ready, press start button!</p>
